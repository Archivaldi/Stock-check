# Stock-check

https://archivaldi.github.io/Stock-check/

Used Materialize, Google Firebase, jQuery, API calls to check stock and crypto prices for users that are signed up. People can use the app without signing up but you will not be able to chat or save the stocks/crypto to your portfolio.
Users were also able to see 1 year and 1 day stock charts for the items searched by them and have the ability to add it to their portfolio.
Created a chat-room feature where users can talk to each other and discuss when they are signed in. Prices in portfolio will change every 5 minutes due to API call restrictions.
